# Qoves interview task

This is a take-home interview project focused on creating educational content about hair loss and male pattern baldness.

## What I Built

I created three interconnected pieces of content that explain hair loss in different ways:

### 1. Clinical Report (`clinical_report.html` + PDF)
A professional-style clinical report covering non-surgical hair loss treatments. Think of it as something you might get from a dermatologist—detailed, evidence-based, and formatted like a medical document.

### 2. Long-Form Article (`article_outline.html`)
An educational article that breaks down male pattern baldness in a more accessible way. It covers the science, causes, and treatment options without being overly technical.

### 3. Interactive Visualization (`visual.html`)
An interactive 3D-ish visualization showing how hair follicles work through their growth cycle. You can toggle between healthy and affected states to see what actually happens during hair loss at a cellular level.

## How to View

Just open any of the HTML files in your browser. The visualization works best in Chrome or Firefox.

## The Goal

The project demonstrates how to take complex medical/scientific information and present it in multiple formats for different audiences—from clinical professionals to curious readers to visual learners.
